patientCluster
======================

Introduction
============
An R package for clustering cohort patients by medical history or creating data-driven medical topics (clusters of concept_ids corresponding to the same medical topic).

There is also a javascript D3 interactive visulisation available for viewing the results.


Features
========
- Aids the creation of topics (sets of similar concept ids)
- Takes a cohort as input and feature definitions (set of individual concept_ids or topics).
- Extracts the necessary data from a database in OMOP Common Data Model format.
- Performs kmeans, generalised low rank models or concensus clustering 
- Includes functions for evaluating clusters and exporting into JSON format
